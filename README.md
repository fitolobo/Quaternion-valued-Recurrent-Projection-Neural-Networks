# Quaternion-valued-Recurrent-Projection-Neural-Networks

Quaternion-valued recurrent projection neural networks (QRPNNs) are obtained by combining the non-local projection learning with the quaternion-valued recurrent correlation neural network (QRCNNs).
QRPNNs overcome the cross-talk problem of QRCNNs and are appropriate to implement associative memories. 
Furthermore, computational experiments reveal that QRPNNs exhibit greater storage capacity and noise tolerance than their corresponding QRCNNs.

This repository contain the Julia source-codes of QRPNNs on unit quaternions, as described in the paper "Quaternion-Valued Recurrent Projection NeuralNetworks on Unit Quaternions" by Marcos Eduardo Valle and Rodolfo Lobo.
The Jupyter-notebook of the computational experimens are also available in this repository.
